**Flappy Bird** is a popular mobile game where the player controls a small bird that must navigate through a series of pipes by tapping the screen to make the bird "flap" and avoid crashing into the pipes or the ground. The game is characterized by simple controls, challenging gameplay, and a focus on achieving a high score. The objective is to guide the bird through the gaps between the pipes, while the bird continuously falls due to gravity. The game became widely known for its addictive nature and minimalist design.
